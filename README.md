### Abstract:

Plastic use is a very present problem, and single use plastics account for a significant chunk of the pollutants. Through this narrative project, we try to visualize facts and misconceptions related to plastic pollution in the U.S., and relate them to policies in different states and from around the world. Our project is unique in that it tackles a very wide problem and yet is able to engage the reader with interactivity (tooltips and guessing games), anomaly detection (line chart patterns of plastic production and recycling in US through time), hypothesis verification (global map chloropleths and news articles), and finally brings the story full circle, while leaving the reader to explore plastic legislation in their on state. We thus attempt to create a holistic narration around plastic contamination and its relation with policy making and legislation, both locally and globally, and leave the reader with a call to action.
