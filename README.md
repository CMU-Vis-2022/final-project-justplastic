# Plastic Waste and Policy Making
### Team Members: Aryan, Allison, Tzu-Sheng and Megan

### Ideas for the final project

#### Tips for the team
1. Please push code, pictures and narrative updates regularly (Everyone)
2. Try to make games - scrolling on the final HTML page (Aryan, Allison and Tzu)
3. Coming up with healthy and smooth transitions and going through covering all of Prof. Dom's points and the marking scheme (Megan)
4. Going through https://parametric.press/issue-02/ and https://parametric.press/issue-02/streaming/ and other examples shared by Prof. Dom.
5. Making the webpage more accessible (10 marks): Try making a  toggle switch with different color schemes for the color blind.
6. Interactivity: Inserting highlights, tooltips, scrolling functions as much as we can. 

#### Graph 1 - Bar Chart
Showing what plastic products are most popular and combining them with clipart and pictures of those products.

#### Graph 2 - Single Use/ Recyclable Statistic for Plastic Over Time
Here we should try to make a guessing game with CSS and HTML like the examples Professor Dom shard with us.

#### Graph 3 - Maps
3 maps are done. Heavy tracing strokes on countries that you zoom into. Try to insert a tooltip if possible (currentky facing errors). But focus is not on the number, but the color, and the fact that two graphs are compliments of each other and two are similar. Order of the graphs should be Production (Blue), Mismanaged (Red), then Export (Green). Preferably in three tabs, so that it is easy to switch and tell a story. 
Another way is to use the embedded maps from the source website, but that is not very good in the flow of the website maybe.

#### Graph 4 - Photos and collage of news articles
China and Turkey's policy changes. And more.

#### Accessibility
1. Use of hue instead of multi-color legends - so color blind people can see the gradation
2. Explanantion of every graph
3. Use of color blind friendly colors

### Launch the app

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

When you push to GitHub, the app automatically deploys to GitHub Pages. As an example, this template repository is deployed at [domoritz.github.io/D3-App-Template](https://domoritz.github.io/D3-App-Template/). See `deploy.yml` for details. Make sure to update the `base` property in `vite.config.ts` to match your repo name.
